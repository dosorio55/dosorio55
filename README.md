# 👋 Hey, I'm Diego

I love coding, automating things, and finding creative solutions to real problems.  
I enjoy making people’s lives easier through technology, understanding how things work under the hood, and building useful tools from scratch.  
I also love collaborating with people and jumping into cool projects — always up to learn something new or build something meaningful together.

## 🧠 Always learning and tinkering

I'm constantly exploring topics like AI, software architecture, distributed systems, and automation.  
Lately, I’ve been working on personal projects, smart dashboards, CRMs, and management apps.
