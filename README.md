# 👨‍💻 Hey there! I'm a Software Developer

I love coding, automating things, and finding creative solutions to real problems.  
I enjoy making people’s lives easier through technology, understanding how things work under the hood, and building useful tools from scratch.  
I also love collaborating with people and jumping into cool projects — always up to learn something new or build something meaningful together.
